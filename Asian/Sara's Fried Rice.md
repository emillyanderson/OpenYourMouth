### Preparation

1. The day before, cook your rice and refrigerate OR if cooking rice the day of, 
	spread rice on a baking sheet and freeze for 25 minutes OR just use regular cooked rice 
2. Chop all of your vegetables before beginning cooking. 
3. In a wok or a large pan, melt your butter. Sauté your carrots 1st, about 2 minutes.
	Then add broccoli, followed by garlic and onion. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sauté for approximately 6 minutes. 
4. While veggies finish cooking, move veggies to the side of your large pan and crack your eggs into the other side. Mix them up so they are scrambled, 
	and season lightly with salt and pepper. Don't over cook them! They will continue cooking for the rest of the process. 
5. Add the green onions, mushrooms, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Stir and coat veggies and egg evenly. 
6. Now add your rice. Stir so everything is evenly distributed and turn the heat to medium high to let the rice crisp up on the bottom. 
7. Add more salt, pepper, and/or soy sauce to taste. Douse in your preferred amount of sriracha. Eat for several days if you live alone, or for just one day if you 
	are feeding 4 of your hungry friends.

Makes about 4-6 servings.
