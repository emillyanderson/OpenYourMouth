### Ingredients

|Ingredient | Qty    |
|:-----------|:------|
| corn tortillas, taco-sized | 20ct |
| lime juice | 1tbsp |
| vegetable oil | 1tbsp |
| seasonings, such as salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder | to taste |


### Preparation

1. Cut tortillas into chip-shaped triangles. I usually stack them up and then get all at once with three cuts through the center to produce six chips per tortilla.
2. Combine the lime juice and oil in a small container. Whisk, shake, or mix vigorously to blend.  
3. Coat both sides of the tortillas with the oil and juice blend. I use a spritzer, but it can be brushed on or tossed in a sealed container in a pinch.
4. Optionally, season the coated chips with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder.
5. Arrange the chips in a single layer on an oiled cookie sheet.
6. Bake at 350Â°f for approximately 15 minutes, flipping once.
