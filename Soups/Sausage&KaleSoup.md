# Sausage, Kale, and Potato Soup

## My take on what was once upon a time an Olive Garden soup, but make it awesome and spicy! 

### Ingredients 
|Ingredients | Measurements US |
|:--- |:--- |
| Bacon | 5 Strips|
| Sausage | 1 lb |
| Tuscan(or regular) Kale | 1 bunch, stems removed and chopped into 1 inch pieces|
| Garlic | 4 Cloves, minced|
| Yellow Onion | 1, chopped |
| Chicken Broth | 2 cartons|
| Red Potatoes | 3 - 5 depending on size, chopped into 1.5 inch pieces |
| Heavy Whipping Cream | 1.5 Cups|
| Red Pepper Flakes | 1 tsp |
| Italian Seasoning | 2 tsp|
| cayenne pepper | to taste |
| salt | to taste | 
| pepper | to taste | 
| White Wine Vinegar | 2 tsp|


### Preparation

1. Cook the bacon in your largest, closest-to-a-dutch-oven looking pot, until slightly crispy. Chop into tiny pieces.  
2. Leave about 3 Tablespoons of the bacon grease and fry your garlic and onions until translucent. 
3. Add your potatoes. Season with cayenne, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.  Fry for 5-10 minutes, just enough to take on some of the garlic and onion flavor. 
4. Add the chicken broth. Simmer on low for up to 2 hours, or until the potatoes are fully cooked. 
5. While soup is simmering, fry the sausage. Add to soup 10 minutes before taking soup off heat. 
6. Add kale and white wine vinegar 5 minutes before taking off heat. 
7. Serve with grilled cheese, a crusty italian bread, or alone. 

I hope you heartily enjoy this recipe! It was on my "to make" list for two years and now it's a favorite.
